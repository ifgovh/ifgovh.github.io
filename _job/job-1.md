excerpt: "Reverse engineering the brain"
collection: job
---

We are inviting applications for a few PhD positions focusing on the exciting intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The selected candidate will collaborate with our team to reverse-engineer multi-scale, data-based models of the brain (cortical and subcortical structures), exploring their working mechanisms and learning capabilities. This research will build upon foundational work such as:

- Chen, Guozhang, Franz Scherr, and Wolfgang Maass. "[Data-based large-scale models provide a window into the organization of cortical computations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538662v3.abstract)." bioRxiv (2023): 2023-04.

- Chen, Guozhang, Franz Scherr, and Wolfgang Maass. "[A data-based large-scale model for primary visual cortex enables brain-like robust and versatile visual processing](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abq7592)." Science Advances 8.44 (2022): eabq7592.

- Chen, Guozhang, and Pulin Gong. "[A spatiotemporal mechanism of visual attention: Superdiffusive motion and theta oscillations of neural population activity patterns.](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abl4995)" Science Advances 8.16 (2022): eabl4995.

- Chen, Guozhang, and Pulin Gong. "[Computing by modulating spontaneous cortical activity patterns as a mechanism of active visual processing.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12918-8)" Nature communications 10.1 (2019): 4915.

In addition, this PhD student will engage in the development of brain-inspired architectures and algorithms for AI, as well as for highly energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.
