We are inviting applications for a few PhD positions focusing on the exciting intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The selected candidate will collaborate with our team to reverse-engineer the brain (cortical and subcortical structures) in multi-scale, data-based models, exploring its working mechanisms and learning capabilities with respect to generalization. This research will build upon foundational work such as:

- Chen, Guozhang, Franz Scherr, and Wolfgang Maass. "[Data-based large-scale models provide a window into the organization of cortical computations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538662v3.abstract)." bioRxiv (2023): 2023-04.

- Chen, Guozhang, Franz Scherr, and Wolfgang Maass. "[A data-based large-scale model for primary visual cortex enables brain-like robust and versatile visual processing](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abq7592)." Science Advances 8.44 (2022): eabq7592.

- Chen, Guozhang, and Pulin Gong. "[A spatiotemporal mechanism of visual attention: Superdiffusive motion and theta oscillations of neural population activity patterns.](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abl4995)" Science Advances 8.16 (2022): eabl4995.

- Chen, Guozhang, and Pulin Gong. "[Computing by modulating spontaneous cortical activity patterns as a mechanism of active visual processing.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12918-8)" Nature communications 10.1 (2019): 4915.

In addition, depending on the interest, PhD students will engage in the development of brain-inspired architectures and algorithms for AI, as well as for highly energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

## Qualifications

- A strong motivation for understanding "how the brain works".
- A strong background in computer science, computational neuroscience, physics, or related fields.
- Proficient skills in mathematics/theory and programming.
- An excellent academic record, demonstrated research potential.
- Intermediate to advanced English reading, communicating and writing skills.

## How to Apply

Interested candidates should submit the following:
- A detailed CV.
- A brief personal statement (explaining your movtivation and plan).
- Academic transcripts.
- Names of referees.
- Links to thesis, publications, and any other relevant documents.
Please send your application with a tile "phd position application" to: guozhang.chen [at] pku.edu.cn
